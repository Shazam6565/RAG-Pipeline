Planning: The agent utilizes task decomposition techniques like Chain of Thought and Tree of Thoughts to break down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals. This enables the agent to plan ahead and handle complex tasks efficiently.\\n\\n2. Reflection and Refinement: The agent engages in self-criticism and self-reflection over past actions, learning from mistakes and refining its approach for future steps. This iterative improvement process allows the agent to enhance the quality of its final results.\\n\\n3. External Classical Planner Integration: In certain setups, the agent may rely on an external classical planner for long-horizon planning. The agent translates the planning problem into PDDL, generates a PDDL plan, and then translates it back into natural language. This integration allows for effective long-term planning in specific scenarios.\\n\\n4. Self-Reflection Integration: The agent integrates self-reflection as a vital aspect of its decision-making process. Techniques like ReAct prompt the agent to generate reasoning traces in natural language, enabling it to refine past action decisions and correct previous mistakes. This integration of self-reflection enables the agent to improve iteratively and adapt to changing circumstances.\\n\\nOverall, the interaction between these components allows the LLM-powered autonomous agent system to exhibit autonomous behavior by effectively planning, reflecting on past actions, integrating external planning tools when necessary, and continuously improving through self-reflection.'"

An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.', metadata={'source': 'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Another quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:', metadata={'source': 'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/'}),\n",

Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\\n\\n\\nChallenges in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging.
